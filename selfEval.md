# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? Nothing really objects are way easier than for statements. 
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? I've found out that taking notes during a lesson is not good for me bc i have a pretty narrow focus. If i take notes i'll get lost and even more confused. It's best for me to pay attention and then re-read later and note key points. 
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? I lean heavily on my own to solve a problem first, probably a little too heavy, I do puzzles on my spare time so i don't mind sitting there deliberating about something for a while but it's not the most time effective.
